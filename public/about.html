<h1>About Me</h1>
Hey, I'm Rahul. I'm a coder and web developer with 
a passion for coding and problem-solving. In my 
free time, I love to cycle or drive around town in
my car. I'm also punctual and always like to have
 fun with whatever I do. Whether it's coding or 
 playing sports, I'm always striving to learn new
  things and improve my skills.
